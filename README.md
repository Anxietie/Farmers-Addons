# CROP MARKERS/LABELS

## Features
- Right click crop markers with crop to change marked crop
- Right click crop markers with nothing in hand to reset it
- Hovering over crop marker will display the name of the marked crop
- Landing on farmland with leather boots will not set it to dirt

## Compatibility
Any items extend `PlantBlock` or `GourdBlock` can be labeled with a crop marker, 
so mods that add items like this will be accounted for.

## Dependencies
- Fabric API
