# FARMER'S ADDONS

## Features
#### Crop Markers/Labels:
- Right click crop markers with crop to change marked crop
- Right click crop markers with nothing in hand to reset it
- Hovering over crop marker will display the name of the marked crop
#### Passive Farmer Ability
- Landing on farmland with leather boots will not set it to dirt
#### Scythes
- Scythes (for harvesting, they don't do much damage) for every material variant
- Right-clicking fully grown crops with a scythe harvests any other fully grown crops around it
- Sharpness enchantment increases the harvest radius per enchantment level

## Compatibility
Any crops that extend `PlantBlock`, `GourdBlock`, or is in `BlockTags.CROPS` can be labeled with a crop marker, 
so mods that add crops with a blockitem are included.<br>
